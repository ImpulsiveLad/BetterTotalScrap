BetterTotalScrap is a quick little mod I cooked up.

Normally the game calculates the end of round scrap collection to be the Scrap Collected/The Total Scrap in the Level

This does not take into account scrap that was not loaded in at the beginning of the match

I have changed it to display the Scrap Collected/Scrap Collected + The Remaining Scrap in the Level + 80 per each apparatus that is still docked

This makes it so that you should never be able to collect more than 100% of the scrap

Yes I have OCD I know

Also I suggest playing with ScanFix just so you can do the math and be satified <3
